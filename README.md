# Walking-Group

### This was a project for CMPT 276 (Intro to Software Engineering) taken in Summer 2018 with Brian Fraser. I worked with 3 other team members to create this application.

Walking Group is an Android application that encourages students to walk to class. It gives them features to walk safely with a walking group, and communicate with group leaders and their parents. Parents of the student can also monitor their children, keeping them safe.

This project interacts with a server made by SFU for this project. It is written in native Java, and interacts with the server using a Retrofit REST interface.

Features of this application include:
* User authentication
* Interaction with Google Maps (using Google Maps API)
* Ability to monitor and be monitored by a user
* Ability to join or create a walking group (using Google Place Picker API)
* Messaging (either emergency or non-emergency messages between groups or parents)
* Automatic GPS uploading (as a background service)
* Purchasable titles
* Purchasable themes
* Leaderboard
